### Iris Dataset Visualization and PCA Project

#### Project Name
**Iris Dataset: Data Visualization and PCA Analysis**

#### Description
This project analyzes the famous Iris dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and visualize key patterns between the features. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the species of three types of iris flowers (*Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, and *Iris-virginica*). The project focuses on visualizing the relationships between features and understanding how PCA can highlight the most significant components that explain the dataset's variance.
